# Sudoku Solver

Whether you are looking to cut down the time you spend playing Sudoku, attempting to grow back the hair you pulled out over the game, trying to beat your suspiciously Sudoku-inclined grandma (I swear, she has the answers hidden in her pockets), or simply don't like the horrid game, then this is the tool for you. The Sudoku Solver removes all the stress<sup>1</sup> away from the game of Sudoku by completely removing human involvement. No longer do you have to miss your sister's wedding because you realized 10 minutes before that you had two 9's in the same row. No longer will you cry when you see images of old men with hair. No longer do you have to loose to players 4x your age. Finally, you can live the Sudoku-free life you always dreamed!

<sup>1</sup> Known to remove delight as well
